IoT Air Quality Monitoring System
This project is an IoT-based air quality monitoring system. It measures PM1.0, PM2.5, PM10, and temperature.
The data is displayed on an OLED screen, with an LED indicator showing air quality status.
The system also has a WiFi-based Web Server, where users can check data in real time.
